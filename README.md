# 🗑️ Garbage Classification using EfficientNetV2B2

This is a deep learning project built as part of my internship.  
It classifies waste into six categories using image classification with EfficientNetV2B2 and transfer learning.

---

## 📂 Dataset
- [Kaggle Dataset – Trash Type Image](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/farzadnekouei/trash-type-image-dataset)
- Contains images of 6 garbage classes: **cardboard, glass, metal, paper, plastic, trash**

---

## ✅ Week 1 Progress

- ✅ Set up Google Colab environment
- ✅ Integrated Kaggle API and downloaded dataset
- ✅ Visualized sample images
- ✅ Created data generators using `ImageDataGenerator`
- ✅ Implemented EfficientNetV2B2 with transfer learning
- ✅ Trained model for 2 epochs (training accuracy ~18%)

## 📘 Week 2 Progress

- Re-trained the garbage classification model using EfficientNetV2B2 for 10 epochs.
- Improved model learning and performance using deeper training.
- Plotted training vs validation accuracy and loss graphs for visual performance tracking.
- Saved this work in a separate Week 2 Colab notebook.
